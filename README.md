# Quanta DeFi Platform

## Overview

**Quanta** is a decentralized lending and borrowing platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to engage in financial operations involving four distinct crypto tokens: **REACT**, **NODE**, **VUE**, and **NEXT**. The platform offers services for depositing, borrowing, and repaying tokens, with dynamic interest rates based on market utilization.

## Key Features

### 1. Token Deposits

Users can deposit any of the supported tokens into the Quanta platform. Depositors earn a fixed annual yield of 5% on their deposits. The platform keeps track of each deposit's details, including the deposit amount and timestamp.

- **Annual Yield**: Deposits earn a fixed interest rate of 5% annually.
- **Flexible Withdrawals**: Users can withdraw their deposited tokens along with the accrued interest.

### 2. Borrowing Mechanism

Users can borrow tokens by providing collateral in one of the other supported tokens. The borrowing process involves the following:

- **Collateral Requirement**: Borrowers must provide collateral worth 150% of the borrowed amount in another supported token.
- **Interest Rates**: Interest rates are calculated based on a base rate of 2% plus an additional rate that varies according to the platform's utilization. The higher the utilization, the higher the interest rate.

### 3. Repayment Process

To repay a borrowed amount, users need to cover the total amount borrowed plus the interest. The repayment process includes:

- **Full Repayment**: Borrowers repay both the principal and the interest amount.
- **Collateral Return**: After repayment, the collateral provided is returned to the borrower.

### 4. Dynamic Interest Rates

The platform calculates interest rates dynamically based on the utilization of the deposited funds:

- **Utilization Rate**: Interest rates increase as the utilization of the deposited funds grows.
- **Rate Adjustment**: The rate is adjusted based on predefined utilization brackets, ranging from 2% to potentially higher rates depending on market conditions.

### 5. User Management

The platform tracks each user's deposits and loans separately. Users can view:

- **User Deposits**: A record of all deposits made by a user, including amounts and timestamps.
- **User Loans**: A record of all loans taken by a user, including amounts, collateral, and repayment status.

## How It Works

1. **Depositing Tokens**: Users deposit tokens into the platform to earn interest.
2. **Borrowing Tokens**: Users can borrow tokens by providing collateral and paying interest based on current utilization rates.
3. **Repaying Loans**: Users repay their loans, including both the principal and interest, and retrieve their collateral.

## Use Cases

- **For Lenders**: Earn a fixed return on your crypto assets by depositing them into the Quanta platform.
- **For Borrowers**: Access liquidity by borrowing tokens with collateral, benefiting from dynamic interest rates based on the platform's utilization.
